# swapi-db

This is my pet-project that I created, when I was inspired by https://starwars-visualguide.com/. 
It's a little copy of Star Wars films and characters database. 
All data is fetched from https://swapi.dev/ as well as images are being imported from https://starwars-visualguide.com/. 

N.B!  From time to time, there are some issues with https://swapi.dev/, so data can be slowly loading or not loading at all. 
If my app is not working correctly, please check if https://swapi.dev/ is up first, and then if swapi is working, please, contact me on github or via email
newerr161@gmail.com. Thanks, and may the force be with you.
